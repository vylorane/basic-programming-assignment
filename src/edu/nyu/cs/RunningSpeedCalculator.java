 * This question is based on Question 1-10 in Liang's Intro to Java textbook.
 * 
 * Complete this program such that it:
 *  - asks the user how many kilometers they have run
 *  - asks the user how many minutes it took them to run that distance
 *  - displays the average speed of the runner in miles per hour
 * 
 * Here is a sample of what the program should output when run, with example user responses - yours should exactly match this pattern:
 *  How many kilometers did you run?
 *  10
 *  How many minutes did it take you?
 *  30
 *  Your average speed was 12.5 miles per hour.

   * Use the Scanner class's nextLine() function to get user input as a String
   * Use the Double.parseDouble() function to covert a String to a double.
   * Do not round any numbers or limit any decimal places in your calculations.
   * Assume 1 mile = 1.609344 kilometers.

   * @param args An array of any command-line arguments.  Java requires the main function include this, even if not used.
   * @throws Exception Allows us to not worry about Exceptions in this function. Java requires the main functino include this, even if not used.
